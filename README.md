# Weather Dashboard

This project was created for the University of Denver's coding bootcamp. This specific application can be used to search for current and future weather data for the city of the user's choice.

## Usage/Examples

To use this site, the user will search the city of their choice. Upon submission, today's forecast and the forecast for the next 5 days will be displayed. This includes city name, date, temperature, wind speed, humidity, and a small icon displaying the weather for that day.
Also, the user's searchs will be displayed as buttons under the submit button. The user can press these buttons to pull up and search for the weather of the corresponding city again.
